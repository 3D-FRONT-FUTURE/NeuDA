# NeuDA

**NeuDA**: Neural Deformable Anchor for High-Fidelity Implicit Surface Reconstruction. CVPR 2023. ([Project page](https://3d-front-future.github.io/neuda), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02375.pdf))

We presents **Deformable Anchors** representation approach and a simple **hierarchical position encoding** strategy. The former maintains learnable anchor points at verities to enhance the capability of neural implicit model in handling complicated geometric structures, and the latter explores complementaries of high-frequency and low-frequency geometry properties in the multi-level anchor grid structure.
